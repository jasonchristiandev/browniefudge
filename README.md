# browniefudge.

## This is a practice project for learning C++, do not expect it to be optimized!

## Description

browniefudge is a brainf*ck compiler that compiles .bf code to .c code.

## Features
1. Compilation of .bf code to .c code
2. Optimization for repeated increments, decrements, pointer movements, and char outputs
3. Macros (sort of like #define in c)     (to do)

```
.bf code ===> intermediate code (optimized) ===> .c code ===> executable
```

## Usage
```
$ browniefudge --help ==> shows help message

$ browniefudge file.bf ==> compiles file.bf to out.c (default)

$ browniefudge file.bf -o name.c ==> compiles file.bf to name.c

$ browniefudge --auto file.bf -o out (only works with gcc styled compilers!) ==> compiles file.bf to executable

$ browniefudge --set-compiler clang ==> sets default compiler to clang

$ brudge ==> alias
```

## Building

Prerequisites:
1. C and C++ compiler
2. Make
3. Windows SDK (on windows)

```
$ make
$ make rebuild ==> cleans before building
```
